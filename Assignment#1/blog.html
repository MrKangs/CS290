            <li>
                <h3>
                    What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment.  How did you solve them?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                There wasn't any troubles that I faced, but uploading an image was the hard part I would say because I don't know how 
                when I was writing the code.

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Mostly everything from this assignment was new to me. All of the syntax of html was new to me. 
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in 
                    completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I used google to find informations for how to use the 'img' tag. 
                Also, I used Piazza for knowing what is the best extension to use for this course.
                The website that I used is this: <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">Img tag</a>
            </p>
        </ol>
