                     to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how confident are you in your web development skills?

                It would be a 2. I can recognize code that it is in html, but I do not know what does it mean.

            <p>
                I hope to learn how to develop a website with just code because I hate using website maker tools. 
                There are so many issues with it.

                Currently, I am working at OPEnS Lab, the lab from the ecological and biological engineering department. 
                In that lab, I am a Compute Science staff member that I cam developing a new programming language
                for the people in the lab who are not used to programming. At the same time, I am doing URSA Engage 
                Research with Professor Cindy Grimm and Bill Smart. Our reseach is finding methods of explaining 
                Computer Vision to the public without technical terms. I am excited for both projects that I am working on.
