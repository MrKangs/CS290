            Questions after doing Assignment #2: 4-24-2020 by Kenneth Kang
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What was challenging about the assignment, 
                    and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  
                    How did you solve those problems?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Majority of the them was a challenge because I had think what I wanted to do with the right syntax. 
                However, the most challenging part would be margins and paddings because I had to think whether I would like to have
                a padding verses a margin in the website.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What did you learn from the assignment?  
                    Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Becuase of this homework, now I have a better understanding of how the CSS works out in general with decorations. 
                However, there will be more since Javascript is also another language that is somewhat similar to CSS. 
            </p>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  
                    The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I used the TA, my peers, and my friendly internet Google to find resources to get help from the homework assignment. 
                For the website, W3school was the one I really like because you can interact with the features in the code to see what changes.
                Another website that I reallt like was https://flexboxfroggy.com/ because I learned a lot more how to use flex better with it. 
                However, to make sure how much I understand, I only use the lecture notes that I have been taking during class with more information
                by watching the recorded lectures one more time. After a certain period that I was unable to do it, I reach out for google first, then peers.
            </p>
            
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I would say that flexboxfroggy was the one I had to use google to understand it better. Also, margin verses padding was the other part
                that I need be make sure about it.
