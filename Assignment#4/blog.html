            Questions after doing Assignment #4: 5-18-2020 by Kenneth Kang
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What was challenging about the assignment, 
                    and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  
                    How did you solve those problems?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Compare to old homework assignments, this one was not hard because most of them were all found in the lecture notes.
                And because of that, I didn't have any problems over the course of doing it.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What did you learn from the assignment?  
                    Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I was very curious how did the server side was like, which I found myself enjoying it. I never know what was going on 
                the server side, which was amazing to learn. Later, I might make a server for my project that I am working on at my work.
            </p>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  
                    The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Unlike last time, I hardly used my peers, TA, or internet. I only used the lecture notes for the most of the time. 
                But nodejs.org, npm, and stack overflow were useful to know what was going on.
            </p>
            
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Searching server setup in stack overflow and knowing module from node was the only part that I really need to google.
                Other than that, I didn't google at all.
