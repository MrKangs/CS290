            Questions after doing Assignment #3: 5-10-2020 by Kenneth Kang
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What was challenging about the assignment, 
                    and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  
                    How did you solve those problems?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Most of the concepts were from the lecture notes, so it wasn't hard. However, the part of extra credit was the most challenging 
                part I would say. In that part, data management of the Twit was challenging because everytime when a twit is deleted, the 
                lenght of the twit get shorter that made it hard to perform the loop that I would like to have.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What did you learn from the assignment?  
                    Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Becuase of this homework, now I have a better understanding of how the basic javascript. After this term, I have a project 
                to make the HCSA website, which javascript, html, and CSS will help me to make the best and outstanding website.
            </p>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  
                    The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I used the TA, my peers, and my friendly internet Google to find resources to get help from the homework assignment. 
                For the TA, Quan was the best that he helped with many parts in my homework assignment will better understanding. For google,
                I used stack overflow, we know that is the best, to find example codes that what I want to perform.  
            </p>
            
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I would say that stack overflow from other programmer's code and W3school was helpful to do it. In that part, I had to google
                how to make an object array, which I found it was simple yet challenging because my set up was different than others.
