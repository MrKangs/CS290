    /* Having the tails on the letter or serif, but not having them are sans-serif */
    /* sens-serif is included in every computer system, so it is good a backup for fonts conditions */

    /* Last way, using rbga will change the color */
    /* The idea is same with rbg, but the last value will merge the background color */
