            Questions after doing Assignment #5: 6-2-2020 by Kenneth Kang
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What was challenging about the assignment, 
                    and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  
                    How did you solve those problems?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I would say that this was the most challenging homework for this class. The concept of handlebars was not confusing, 
                but (properbly) the motivation of being focus on the last 2 weeks were hard to me. I am going to be part of the HTML/CSS team member for 
                my final project.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    What did you learn from the assignment?  
                    Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                I learned a lot of how we can simply reduce hardcoded html and js by using handlebars, 
                yet I still need to investigate more into it since there was a lot of information
                to cover.
            </p>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  
                    The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Lecture notes was one part that helped me a lot. But also, my friend Adam Kerr helped me explaning how things were going with handlebars.

            <li>
                <h3>
                    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                </h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                getting the error of uncaught type error message when adding a new twit was the confusing part to figure it out.
